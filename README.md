# ClickCounter

As the project name states this is an application that counts mouse clicks :) It sits in tray and is rather intuitive to use.
I've prepared a build that can be downloaded in [releases section](https://github.com/gaskoin/ClickCounter/releases) or simply by clicking [here](https://github.com/gaskoin/ClickCounter/releases/download/v1.0/ClickCounter.exe).

Enjoy!
